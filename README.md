# LENDING CLUB CASE STUDY
> Lending Club case study is about a consumer finance company, which is the largest online loan marketplace,which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant's profile.

Two types of risks are associated with the bank's decision:
* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. the borrower is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

## Analysis Approach

- The analysis is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default or not.
- This pattern will be used by consumer finance company for taking actions such as __denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc__.

## Conclusions
- From the EDA which we have done on the Finance Company dataset about loan lending. We have found out patterns that the finance copany can consider in future, before lending loan to applicants to reduce number of defaulters.

  - Finance company need to verify the loan applicant's state, as ,most of the defaulters are from CA, FL, NY, TX.
  - Loan applicants are higher with the applicants having garde B in employment. So, we can increase the loan interest to certain percentage. This will have a good profit for the company.
  - Loan applied for Renewabe energy has less chance to get Charged off. So, more number of applicant having purpose as Renewable Energy can be approved. As, the Renewable Energy has high profit in the market our company can grant more loan on this.
  - It is advisable to get the loan applicant background verified, to minimize the number of Charged off count.
  - Applicant residing in rented house are high to apply for loan, before granting loan verify the income of the applicant and state of resident.
